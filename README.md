As this is the time when the students are learning from home , there are the certain things which they want to access for their betterment of studies. 

Most of the Students especially in the engineering field, want to set the target and want to score good Grades and GPA so due to the inner process of colleges they even don’t know that how they can achieve required CGPA and GPA i.e in what subject they should target what grade to attain the targeted CGPA.

Even they don’t have access to check their attendance that how many classes they can leave in case of emergency without appearing in DEBAR LIST in VIT.

Hence for solving these problems we the TECHION group(ASHUTOSH KUMAR, SHUBHAM MISHRA, SPARSH JAIN, SHAURYAN BHARDWAJ, SHREY SRIVASTAVA) has come up with an initiative to design such a platform where the students can continue their learning from home easily with all the resource which they want during this time. .

And we have given this platform a name that is  VIT INVENTORY
